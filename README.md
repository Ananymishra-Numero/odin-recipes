# Odin Recipes

This is a simple HTML project for **The Odin Project** foundations course. The project demonstrates the following skills:

- Basic Git and GitHub workflow
- Structuring a project with multiple files and folders
- Writing semantic HTML
- Creating links between pages
- Using lists, headings, and images in HTML

By the end of this project, I will have a solid understanding of basic web page structuring and navigation.
